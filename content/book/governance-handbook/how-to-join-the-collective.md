# How to join the collective

1. Check out our [bios]({{< relref "/book/administrivia/group-members-interests-and-roles" >}}) to get a sense of who we are, and explore our [Loomio group](https://www.loomio.org/economikit/) to see what we're doing. If you like us and want to chat more, just send a request to join on Loomio. This will send us an email, and we'll be in touch.
2. We'll send you an invite to a periodical collective video call. Whoever is on the call will greet you and ask you to tell a story about how you came to be here. (We have a practise of telling lots of stories.)
3. After the call, we'll chat a bit about how the interaction felt and pass on your details to the rest of the collective. We usually provide a 1-week voting period for anybody to raise any blockers before committing and approving your Loomio invite.
4. If approved, you'll become just as much a part of the collective as the rest of us and the goal will be to deepen our relationship over time. Somebody will add you to internal accounts for shared document and chat access and you can jump in wherever & whenever feels good for you.
