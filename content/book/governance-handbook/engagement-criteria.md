# Engagement criteria

[TOC]

## Guiding questions

- What anchors or waypoints help us make coherent decisions about who to align with or what to work on?
- What makes something a clear no?
- What are the attractors we/you are looking for?
- How do you know it when you see it?

## Goal anchors

Ways in which our behaviour should direct human action, flows and potential.

### Facilitate sovereignty, agency & autonomy

- Disperse power to those without it
    - Decision-making and governance being retained within communities (not deferred, especially not aggregated to external forces)
    - Member-directed, not board-directed
    - Prefer non-hierarchical, "leaderful" governance
    - Mandate clear articulation of necessary hierarchical structures & organisational power dynamics (it's a necessary predicate for the implementation of agent-centric tech)
- Uphold individual & collective autonomy of technical infrastructure and data
    - Data ownership linked to place; resilience to access in the face of infrastructural uncertainty
    - Agency over updates & changes
    - Responsible management of individual & collective sovereignty / identity
- Build sensemaking systems, not game-theoretic models
    - Aversion to big data and AI; prefer "little data" and human reasoning
    - Game theory & economics as a "rivalrous game"
- Provide unenclosable carriers
    - Data ownership linked to provenance; control over sharing
    - No eavesdropping or monitoring
    - Self-managed keys, "social encryption", peer recovery & shamir-sharing
    - Facilitate compassion along the whole supply chain

### Create deep wealth

- Leverage self-generative wealth, avoid injected capital
    - Avoiding money as a way of elevating from poverty
    - Creating sufficiency, abundance & thrivability
    - Recurring, localised income streams
- Acknowledge existing value & wealth
    - Making pluralistic value forms perceptual, meaningful and actionable

### Practise generative finance

- Build mutual & interest-free debt issuance systems
- Avoid extractive business practises
    - Preference to avoid equity-based investment entirely
    - Limited investments with capped returns considered reasonable
    - Private equity as a way of involving community members

> [name=pospi] *To-do: calculation of 'degrees of abstraction' from value created; formalisation of thresholds.*

### Reduce inequity

- Elevate marginalised demographics to reduce gaps in empowerment
- "Nothing about us without us!"
- Avoid solely empowering those already advantaged (especially in the socio-political context of the problem space; but more broadly as well)

### Build commons

- Prioritise groups growing natural, knowledge, social & technological commons (in that order?); collective benefit
    - Further prioritise groups working to preserve Indigenous knowledge systems
- Preference for OSS contributions
    - But we will accept paid work for proprietary contracts; need to define how that input flows back into commons-supporting or sponsorship initiatives
- Make up-front commitments towards commons contributions, not deferring to "phase 2 & beyond" & beholden to investment / income streams

### Create relationships

- Create local sufficiency, abundance and autonomy
- Facilitate human connection & build mutual aid support systems
- Deepen cross-cultural understanding & socio-economic dependencies between local groups
- Engage with diverse stakeholders from a variety of cultural, racial, social & political backgrounds

### Maintain a feminist culture

- Only work with organisations considering themselves "feminist", "intersectional", or compatible with these ideologies
- Value non-productive labor; reverance for stigmergic organising principles, "soft skills", "connector" and "care" work
- Aversion to techno-utopianism, market-based solutionism, misoginy & chauvinism
    - Lost opportunity cost
    - Reputational damage, "guilt by association"
- Consent-based decision making (not consensus or control-based)


----



## Constraint anchors

The pragmatic questions we must weigh in whenever deciding on engaging with a new collaborator.

### Time available

- Projects should be weighted against the market opportunity & time window available to maximise impact
- Estimated time to delivery & energy expenditure

### Sustainability of the work

- Do we have the people-power?
- Do we have the financial runway?
- Yes we want $, but not at the expense of ethical/moral criteria



----



## Weighing anchors

- How to weigh goal vs constraint anchors?
- Any particular violations of an anchor which make something a clear no?
- Cost (social, political, natural, financial, ...) of not having anchors fulfilled?



----



## Characteristics we might articulate

- while functioning in neoliberal context actually transcend it by creating agency without overly exposing agents to centralized control.
- demonstrate that we not only want to move beyond corruption and extorting middle men but also transform the implied power relation of "aid" schemes
- lean toward organic growth of ideal forms brought into lived practice rather than grabbing wave of opportunity to have fleeting garbage which doesn't work in practice but does bring short term visibility or funding.
