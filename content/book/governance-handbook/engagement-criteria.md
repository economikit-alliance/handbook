## Understanding this document

You won't find a values statement or list of our beliefs on this website. Each of us has participated in organisations that have spent many hours debating such things&mdash; a process which we have found often lacks integrity when it comes to its enactment and embodiment in daily practise.

Thus, we do not think it is very interesting to talk about the beliefs we share. Instead, we think it is much more powerful to speak to *what we will do together*.

The following "anchors" provide a grounding to guide us in that process. You can think of this set of criteria similarly to those you'd encounter in a job interview&mdash; everything is aspirational, and we don't expect that any organisations will be able to tick all these boxes (including ourselves). Rather, these are communicated here to indicate *how* we assess and prioritise potential engagements and partnerships. Compromising some values in the pursuit of others is sometimes acceptable, but only if it comes with clarity, transparency and accountability as to why we made such choices.

We have also created this list because (for the first time in history, we believe) *all of these aims are technologically achievable*. The only barriers that remain are social, political and cultural... barriers which, we hope, will shift slowly as we progress through this work.















## Goal anchors

These define our aims, hopes and dreams; and thus, the kinds of groups we are seeking to collaborate with.

An effort is made to lean the writing of this section toward an *active verb* style, and to avoid nouns in our phrasing.[^engverbs] Especially in the context of assessing our behaviours and actions, nouns inherently create a reductionism and loss of information over our thought process. What happens is that we end up taking a stream of opinions, events and memories and compressing them together mentally before making a final judgement that "we uphold diversity" or "this group works to empower others". Instead, we hope to create a culture where *in every action* we ask the question&mdash; "is what I am about to do going to *uphold individual and collective sovereignty*?" (for example).

You can create your own anchors, too. The guiding questions we used to light our way began simply:

- What anchors or waypoints help us make coherent decisions about who to align with or what to work on?
- What makes something a clear no?
- What are the attractors we/you are looking for?
- How do you know it when you see it?

What follows are our answers to these questions.





### Uphold individual and collective sovereignty

We believe that both individual and collective sovereignty are necessary features of any generative system. We believe that technical infrastructure and data should be held both by individuals and groups, and that the needs of both must be weighted when deciding who holds which information. We believe that individualism is an illusion and that data is held in the relational space between people&mdash; data generated in a group context is less valuable when divorced from that context. We also believe that in most cases individuals should retain provenance of such data for their own records upon exiting a group.

We stand with Indigenous peoples in their fight for independence and acknowledge the centuries-old struggles for sovereignty and self-determination that are still ongoing. We acknowledge that their struggles are not our own, but are interrelated; and see that in a post-911, post-COVID world the harms of colonisation are becoming increasingly universal.

**We like:**

- Personal data ownership and direct control over exposure and sharing.
- Collectively holding information among groups of peers, rather than in trusted nodes with shared access.
- Individual control over the installation of software updates and changes.
- Projects which create resilience in and agency over physical and digital infrastructure, and reduce dependency on external providers.
- Self-managed encryption keys, end-to-end encryption and access recovery without the involvement of custodial or central authorities.

**We try to avoid:**

- Eavesdropping and monitoring of communications and data by external parties.






### Facilitate agency and autonomy

We believe that many of the current injustices in the world emerge as a result of unequal power dynamics and access to information. We believe that every human being has the right to define and practise their own culture, and that such practises should be wholly held and operated under that group's own authority. We believe that agency and Place are fundamentally interwoven, and that the possibility for autonomy in technological systems depends on local access to data, without intermediaries. We acknowledge the tension between self-monitoring of data to provide insight, and data as a panopticon when handled externally or without mutually enforced ethical agreements.

**We like:**

- Clear articulation of organisational power dynamics and decision-making processes. Adoption of agent-centric[^agentcentrictech] technologies.
- Dispersing power to those without it.
- Working with those "on the ground" to understand their needs rather than designing models as an 'architect' of the system.
- Technological systems which involve humans in their operation to provide flexibility, nuance and room for manoeuvre.
- Decision-making and governance processes that are retained within the communities affected by them.
- Member-directed governance models, rather than board-directed ones.
- Sense-making[^sensemaking] systems and "empowerment to" design processes; human-scale reasoning. Game theory as a statistical modelling tool.

**We try to avoid:**

- Designs which defer decision-making processes to external forces (whether these be human, collective or AIs)
    - Especially those where power over many is aggregated into the hands of few.
- Game-theoretic operational models and other "power over" design patterns; use of AI and Big Data.





### Implement contextual solutions

We believe that universal solutions propagate monocultures which are oppressive and harmful to places and peoples whom are typically overlooked by mainstream Western thought. We also believe that such attempts at systems change are fundamentally unlikely to succeed, and that real progress emerges from the bottom upwards.

We believe that the needs and goals of communities differ, and that it is a mistake to attempt to service the needs of all. We aim to support the immediate needs of those we collaborate with whilst engendering a sensitivity to the needs of other beings and developing protocols for knowing and harmonising between different belief systems and ways of life.

**We like:**

- Use of existing protocols and the creation of strong protocol designs. A focus on interoperability between technologies and communities.
- Constellations of targeted, special-purpose currencies rather than singular or monolithic economic models.
- Business models which are not based on the number of users of a platform.
- Place-based platforms which aim to assist a single community and have no growth imperative beyond that.
- Biomimetic, nature-inspired technologies and adaptable systems.

**We try to avoid:**

- Utilitarian ethics and projects who believe that "everybody ought to" or "one size fits all".
- Acting on techno-utopian belief systems which ignore or oversimplify the social dynamics of human beings.





### Create deep wealth

We think of "deep wealth"[^deepwealth] as complementary to self-sufficiency, resilience and autonomy. We believe that money fundamentally *causes* inequity via extractive social consequences and cannot play any role other than a transitionary one in lasting solutions to ending poverty. We realise that the injection of capital also usually leads to the creation of hierarchy.

**We like:**

- Solutions which acknowledge existing value and wealth. Embracing what is already working.
- Making pluralistic value forms perceptual, meaningful and actionable.
- Turning externalities into internalities.
- The creation of self-generative wealth and life support systems.
- Recurring, localised income streams.
- Efforts towards sufficiency, abundance and thrivability[^thrivability].
- Efforts moving towards a degrowth[^degrowth] economy in some sense or another, particularly where the goal is to reduce complexity in the supply chain.

**We try to avoid:**

- Market-based solutionism and individualist logics.
- Moves which rely solely on money to succeed.
- Token-based thinking and efforts relying on speculative value.
- Capital injected by 'external stakeholders', uncapped equity based returns or promises of 'growth unto perpetuity'.




    

### Practise generative finance

We believe that money is an important flow among the many streams of value embedded in physical and social reality. We acknowledge it as a necessity for meeting our basic needs in Capitalist society, whilst also being mindful of its social consequences and the need to move beyond it. The financial models which we engage with, adopt and employ should thus prepare those they affect for exiting the Capitalist system. This means mirroring the locally generative and resilient models of Deep Wealth, and reducing dependency on external stakeholders.

**We like:**

- Optimising for non-exploitative, non-extractive business models.
- The creation of mutual & interest-free debt issuance systems.
- Voluntary charitable contributions.
- Private equity as a way of nurturing communities of interest and engaging community members.
- Transforming the implied power relation of aid schemes to place those receiving capital in control of its distribution.
- Capped returns on investment, and explicit articulation of extraction relative to the real (tangible) value generated.

**We try to avoid:**

- Debt-based issuance and loans.
- Uncapped returns and the growth logic of Silicon Valley.
- Extracting value from the natural environment, human interactions, data or licensing & service fees.
- Engaging with efforts which create short-term visibility or funding but do not have long-lasting practical applicability in lived practise.







### Reduce inequity

Our theory of change focuses on equity, not equality. You can imagine an invisible *'Mountain of Privilege'* that all of us are climbing. The goal of *equity* is for those higher up the mountain to reach down and help those further down the hill to climb higher. With *equality*, we instead treat everybody the same&mdash; which often means that while our overall privileges and rights may have been raised, the gap between the haves and the have-nots does not change.


**We like:**

- Representation and leadership from those affected by the deployment of the systems we create. This includes the early consultation and design processes&mdash; "Nothing about us without us!"[^nothingaboutus]
- Efforts that elevate marginalised demographics to reduce gaps in empowerment.

**We try to avoid:**

- Solely empower those already advantaged
    - Especially in the socio-political context of the problem space, but more broadly as well.
- Act towards "elevating everybody" without defining exactly whom "everybody" is.





### Build commons

We believe that survival of our species amidst the challenges of our time hinge upon our ability to responsibly and sustainably govern commons.[^commonstransition]

We prioritise our efforts first toward those which sustain, steward and regenerate natural & environmental commons. In all work we also aim to build towards sustainability and commoning at the social layer, and finally the technological layer(s) deemed necessary to underpin this work. We believe this ordering is important, and that our deepest service as beings in this new phase of existence should be toward the 'base layers' on which our survival depends&mdash; geologies, water flows, soil, fungi, bacteria and eventually flora, fauna, other human beings and the invisible agreements we make when coordinating together.

**We like:**

- Actions which grow natural, knowledge, social & technological commons; where the outcomes have a collective benefit.
- The preservation, sharing and elevation of Indigenous knowledge systems and ways of knowing.
- Bioregional scale governance and stewardship efforts.
- Open-source software, open contributions, codes of conduct.
- Up-front commitments towards commons contributions.
- Strong governance around the sharing of dividends and surplus.

**We try to avoid:**

- "Making things financially sustainable" before defining the commitments that groups will make to their commons.
- Making people dependent on development teams and technical expertise to continue operating and innovating.






### Create relationships

We see change as an emergent, accountable and collaborative process; not a destination. We believe that the best way to engender material resilience is in engendering social resilience, and that socio-economic dependencies between local groups can deepen trust and cross-cultural understanding.

**We like:**

- Acting and building in ways which lead toward gratitude and generosity.
- Creating localised and place-based solutions which connect people with others nearby.
- Bridge-building and efforts to facilitate compassion between communities; especially across production supply chains.
- Facilitating human connection and building mutual aid[^mutualaid] support systems.
- Integrated software interfaces; *'non-sided marketplaces'* where participants can assume any role.
- Intergenerational teams and organisations.

**We try to avoid:**

- Creating 'split' interfaces which segregate participants in a system into different worldviews.







### Hold awareness for subjectivity & diversity

Subjectivity is an ongoing creative struggle which we aim to continually and consciously explore. We welcome others looking to live into new possibilities for diversifying their relationships, increasing representation in their circles and widening their personal expressive capacity. We recognise the Invisibility of Race and celebrate all kinds of diversity, remembering that our physical characteristics do not show us the whole picture.

We believe that the forces of Colonialism and Patriarchy require an active resistance in order to be overcome. We support and elevate the efforts of groups expressing Intersectional, Feminist and Anti-Colonial attitudes.
We favour empowerment efforts which widen the availability and accessibility of different roles, rather than elevating "women's work" or "soft skills" as a separate category of contribution.

Anti-capitalism without intersectionality is class reductionism.

Intersectionality without anti-capitalism is just liberal identity politics.

**We like:**

- Engaging with diverse stakeholders from a variety of cultural, racial, social & political backgrounds.
- Using consent-based[^consentbased] decision making (not consensus or control-based).
- Non-violent communication and dispute resolution practises.
- Being humble in the way we express our opinions and handle feedback.

**We try to avoid:**

- Normalising 'maleness' or 'whiteness' in the way that data is aggregated, labelled and understood.
- Hurriedly moving through conflict with the goal of "stopping" rather than "understanding" the problem.
- Engaging with misogynistic and chauvinistic attitudes and behaviour.












## Constraint anchors

Our goals give us the ideal world, but this world is far from ideal. There are of course the standard pragmatic questions we must weigh and factor in whenever deciding on engaging with a new collaborator.

Briefly, these are&mdash;

### Time available

Projects should be weighted against the market opportunity and time window available to maximise impact. Estimated time to delivery and the energy cost to our team need to be assessed, keeping in mind our available bandwidth over the projected time window.

### Sustainability of the work

For us this involves a few straightforward questions:

- Do we have the people-power?
- Do we have the financial runway?
- Will the outcome of this engagement be that we are more or less financially secure after engaging with it?

In other words: yes, we need funding in order to survive. We make the above 'goal anchors' visible to ensure that we do not take funding at the expense of our ethical & moral criteria.

### Space for reflection

Defining space for reflection at the start of a project is important in evolving our ongoing understanding of our work. In all efforts undertaken we endeavour to explicitly nominate a time for reflecting on what we have done together, learning from our experiences and improving our processes.
