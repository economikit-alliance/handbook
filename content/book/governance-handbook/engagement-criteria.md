# Engagement criteria


You won't find a values statement or list of our beliefs on this website. Each of us has participated in organisations that have spent many hours debating such things&mdash; a process which we have found often lacks integrity when it comes to its enactment and embodiment in daily practise.

Thus, we do not think it is very interesting to talk about the beliefs we share. Instead, we think it is much more powerful to speak to *what we will do together*.

The following "anchors" provide a grounding to guide us in that process. You can think of this set of criteria similarly to those you'd encounter in a job interview&mdash; everything is aspirational, and we don't expect that any organisations will be able to tick all these boxes. Rather, these are communicated here to indicate *how* we assess and prioritise potential engagements and partnerships. Compromising some values in the pursuit of others is sometimes acceptable, but only if it comes with clarity, transparency and accountability as to why we made such choices.

We have also created this list because (for the first time in history, we believe) *all of these aims are technologically achievable*. The only barriers that remain are social, political and cultural... barriers which, we hope, will shift slowly as we progress through this work.

## Guiding questions

- What anchors or waypoints help us make coherent decisions about who to align with or what to work on?
- What makes something a clear no?
- What are the attractors we/you are looking for?
- How do you know it when you see it?





## Goal anchors

Ways in which our behaviour should direct human action, flows and potential.

### Implement contextual solutions

We believe that universal solutions propagate monocultures which are oppressive and harmful to places and peoples whom are typically overlooked by mainstream Western thought. We also believe that such attempts at systems change are fundamentally unlikely to succeed, and that real progress emerges from the bottom upwards.

We believe that the needs and goals of communities differ, and that it is a mistake to attempt to service the needs of all. We aim to support the immediate needs of those we collaborate with whilst engendering a sensitivity to the needs of other beings and developing protocols for knowing and harmonising between different belief systems and ways of life.

**We like:**

- Business models which are not based on the number of users of a platform.
- Strong protocol designs and a focus on interoperability between technologies and communities.
- Place-based platforms which aim to assist a single community and have no growth imperative beyond that.

<!-- - Commons-producing models that primarily aim create common works or steward natural commons; particularly where the goal is to create knowledge commons or transparency in supply chains.
- Constellations of targeted, special-purpose currencies rather than singular or monolithic economic models. -->

**We try to avoid:**

- Utilitarian ethics and projects who believe that "everybody ought to" or "one size fits all".


### Facilitate sovereignty, agency & autonomy

We believe that many of the current injustices in the world emerge as a result of unequal power dynamics and access to information. We believe that every human being has the right to define and practise their own culture, and that such practises should be wholly held and operated under that group's own authority. We believe that agency and Place are fundamentally interwoven, and that the possibility for autonomy in technological systems depends on local access to data, without intermediaries. We acknowledge the tension between self-monitoring of data to provide insight, and data as a panopticon when handled externally or without mutually enforced ethical agreements.

We believe that both individual and collective autonomy are necessary features of any generative system. We believe that technical infrastructure and data should be held both by individuals and groups, and that the needs of both must be weighted when deciding who holds which information. We believe that individualism is an illusion and that data is held in the relational space between people&mdash; data generated in a group context is less valuable when divorced from that context. We also believe that in most cases individuals should retain provenance of such data for their own records upon exiting a group.

We stand with Indigenous peoples in their fight for independence and acknowledge the centuries-old struggles for sovereignty and self-determination that are still ongoing. We acknowledge that their struggles are not our own, but are interrelated; and see that in a post-911 world the harms of colonisation are becoming increasingly universal.

**We require:**

- Clear articulation of organisational power dynamics and decision-making processes (the technologies we use necessitate such clarity).

**We like:**

- Working with those "on the ground" to understand their needs rather than designing models as an 'architect' of the system.
- Technological systems which involve humans in their operation to provide flexibility, nuance and room for manoeuvre.
- Data ownership and individual agency over exposure and sharing.
- Projects which create resilience in and agency over physical and digital infrastructure, and reduce dependency on external providers.
- Self-managed encryption keys, "social encryption", and distributed access recovery without central authorities.
- Individual control over the installation of software updates and changes.
- Decision-making and governance processes that are retained within the communities affected by them.
- Member-directed governance models, rather than board-directed ones.
- [Sense-making](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LqaotiGWjQ) systems and "empowerment to" design processes; human-scale reasoning. Game theory as a statistical modelling tool.
- Bridge building and efforts to facilitate compassion between communities; especially across production supply chains.

<!-- - Disperse power to those without it -->
<!-- - Non-hierarchical, "leaderful" governance. -->
<!-- - Context & awareness of externalities, rather than blind to them but (hopefully) manipulated to work in service to them -->

**We try to avoid:**

- Projects which defer decision-making processes to external forces (whether these be human, collective or AIs)
    - Especially those where power over many is aggregated into the hands of few.
- Eavesdropping and monitoring of communications and data by external parties.
- Game-theoretic operational models and other "power over" design patterns; use of AI and Big Data.

### Create deep wealth

- Leverage self-generative wealth, avoid injected capital
    - Dropping capital on things tends to also drop hierarchy on them
    - Avoiding money as a way of elevating from poverty
    - Creating sufficiency, abundance & thrivability
        - TODO: unpack these?
    - Recurring, localised income streams
- Acknowledge existing value & wealth
    - Making pluralistic value forms perceptual, meaningful and actionable
    - Embrace what is already working
    - efforts moving towards a [degrowth economy](https://www.degrowth.info/en/what-is-degrowth/) in some sense or another, particularly where the goal is to reduce complexity in the supply chain

### Practise generative finance

- Build mutual & interest-free debt issuance systems
- Avoid extractive funding models
    - Preference to avoid equity-based investment entirely
    - Limited investments with capped returns considered reasonable
    - Private equity as a way of involving community members
- Optimise for non-exploitative, non-extractive business models
    - Turn externalities into internalities

> [name=pospi] *To-do: calculation of 'degrees of abstraction' from value created; formalisation of thresholds.*

### Reduce inequity

- Elevate marginalised demographics to reduce gaps in empowerment
- "Nothing about us without us!"
- Avoid solely empowering those already advantaged (especially in the socio-political context of the problem space; but more broadly as well)

### Build commons

- Prioritise groups growing natural, knowledge, social & technological commons (in that order?); collective benefit
    - Further prioritise groups working to preserve Indigenous knowledge systems
- Preference for OSS contributions
    - But we will accept paid work for proprietary contracts; need to define how that input flows back into commons-supporting or sponsorship initiatives
- Make up-front commitments towards commons contributions, not deferring to "phase 2 & beyond" & beholden to investment / income streams

### Create relationships

> [name=Sid] there's more here, needs better words

- Gratitude as an indication of a healthy relationship
- Prefer localised & place-based solutions
- Create local sufficiency, abundance and autonomy
- Facilitate human connection & build mutual aid support systems
- Deepen cross-cultural understanding & socio-economic dependencies between local groups
- Integrated software interfaces; "non-sided marketplaces"
- Engage with diverse stakeholders from a variety of cultural, racial, social & political backgrounds
- Change as an emergent, accountable and collaborative process; not a destination

### Hold awareness for subjectivity & diversity

Subjectivity is an ongoing creative struggle which we aim to continually and consciously explore. We welcome others looking to live into new possibilities for diversifying their relationships, increasing representation in their circles and widening their personal expressive capacity.

- Widening the possibilities for personal expressive capacity.
- The forces of Colonialism and Patriarchy require an active resistance in order to be overcome.
- Projects which do not normalise maleness in the way that data is aggregated.
- Favour efforts which widen the availability and accessibility of different roles, rather than elevating "women's work" or "soft skills" as a separate category of effort.
- Physical characteristics do not show us the whole picture.

- Work with organisations considering themselves "intersectional", "justice-oriented", "feminist" or compatible with these ideologies
- Aversion to techno-utopianism, market-based solutionism, misoginy & chauvinism
- Consent-based decision making (not consensus or control-based)
- Humility

<!-- - Value non-productive labor; reverance for stigmergic organising principles, "soft skills", "connector" and "care" work -->


Anti-capitalism without intersectionality is class reductionism.

Intersectionality without anti-capitalism is just liberal identity politics.

## Constraint anchors

The pragmatic questions we must weigh in whenever deciding on engaging with a new collaborator.

### Time available

- Projects should be weighted against the market opportunity & time window available to maximise impact
- Estimated time to delivery & energy expenditure

### Sustainability of the work

- Do we have the people-power?
- Do we have the financial runway?
- Yes we want $, but not at the expense of ethical/moral criteria
- Defining spaces for reflection at the start of a project



----



## Weighing anchors

- How to weigh goal vs constraint anchors?
- Any particular violations of an anchor which make something a clear no?
- Cost (social, political, natural, financial, ...) of not having anchors fulfilled?



----



## Characteristics we might articulate

- while functioning in neoliberal context actually transcend it by creating agency without overly exposing agents to centralized control.
- demonstrate that we not only want to move beyond corruption and extorting middle men but also transform the implied power relation of "aid" schemes
- lean toward organic growth of ideal forms brought into lived practice rather than grabbing wave of opportunity to have fleeting garbage which doesn't work in practice but does bring short term visibility or funding.
