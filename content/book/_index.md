# To do

* Put something other than our to-do list on this page :P
* Agree as a group on a document collaboration platform
* Agree as a group on a communication / asynchronous discussion tool
* Need others to create CoMakery accounts and advise as to email address so that pospi can add admins to the Holo-REA project & assign batches.
  * Governance conversation: who should have admin access?
* Need to author good project descriptions for both Holo-REA and ValueFlows-UI
* Need to create good branding imagery for both Holo-REA and ValueFlows-UI
  * \(should probably make a batch for this and throw a bounty in there to coax a designer into doing it?\)
  * \(Anyone know a good graphic designer?\)
* Create some task batches for stuff we need to do internally within the group \(incl. the above\)

\(for later\)

* Find someone to make nice videos, or record project demo videos
  * Build some UIs for Holo-REA that would actually make this impressive; I suggest a work logging and inventory management UI which update in real time response to each other
  * Batch for wider community: graphql subscriptions API for Holochain apps

## Random things to think about

* How best to handle the information architecture for a collaborative brand like this? I envisage… separate websites / gitbooks for each project’s own documentation, with an overarching website which leads people into each subproject.
* “Overarching” website probably wants to be largely tailored for business analyst types; detailing use of the different toolkit components by way of real-world examples.
* Guiding governance that enables us to build a coherent strategy.

## **Economic Design for the Collective:**

_Initial ramble by Sid, feel free to add comments/ask for clarifications:_

Guardrails:

* Co-op like structure for funding instruments. I.e. Credits/Zero coupon bonds/IOUs preferred over shares.
* Eventually, the currency would operate as a value-stable resource i.e. drawing on designs of sufficiency. However, the initial phase may rely on scarcity dynamics \(Similar to the HOT to HF transition\)

Short/Medium term Intentions:

* To design some form of material currency that enables people who wish to support this project to contribute, and benefit in some way in monetary terms. It could be along the lines of an economic system we created for [SC with David Atkinson way back.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xK-UBYwzgGCwuaiQRrh19yoZJRfPtHE5UWTC5sSiZLg/edit)
* Governance structure, and internal reputation system that guides the flow of material capital
* Open questions: external capital? Tradable currency?

Longer term intentions:

* A currency system that enables frictionless capital deployment on a need-basis
* One way to go about it is to create a breathable supply, that allows fresh issuances on the basis of reputation-at-stake.

Thoughts on Governance

Thoughts on Reputation System

Thoughts on Monetary System:

* Suite of Micro-services that invoice applications on the basis of computation capacity drawn down? What is the feasibility of this?
* Open-source system driven purely by reputation currency + grants from enthusiastic funders?

**Marketing/Outreach/Comms/Design Sessions/Hackathons etc.**

_Sid: I think there’s definitely a need for an over-arching story to be told here. My sense is it could be deeply moving and attractive for all stakeholders. Giving some thought to this over the weekend._
