# Accountability guardrails

> [name=pospi] Todo: needs expanding, also narration on why these things are important

* **accountability** \(I answer to others\)
  * \(for those using\)
    * [Enable third-party critique](https://github.com/holo-rea/ecosystem/wiki/Modules-in-the-HoloREA-framework#links)
  * \(for those building\)
    * Governance of [shared language structures](https://github.com/holo-rea/ecosystem/wiki/Modules-in-the-HoloREA-framework#specification) for describing resources and processes
    * What should [and should not be](https://cdw1.commonsengine.org/t/many-things-are-measurable-what-things-get-damaged-in-the-measuring/99) measured?
    * A discussion needs to be started! \(\#protocol-councils\)
* **interoperability** \(I can speak with others\)
  * common vocabularies \(especially resource ontologies\)
  * protocol bridges
  * data translators
  * choice of platform \(protocol, integration & consultation work\)
* **accessibility** \(I can use it\)
  * free as in money, free as in freedom
  * simplicity
  * configurability
* **extensibility** \(I can build with it\)
  * hyper-modularity
  * pluggability
  * good architecture \(the simplest code that can do the job\)
* **agility** \(I am not attached to it\)
  * \(see 'extensibility'\)
  * re-questioning appropriateness of protocol & technology
  * receptivity to other protocols and technologies

> [name=Sid] I can add a few guardrails for economic design of the collective. For example: following a co-op structure, value accruing to instruments like credits, instead of shares \(sufficiency instead of scarcity etc.\)
