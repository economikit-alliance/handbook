# Core beliefs and principles

* The future is female. We aim to embody and spread the adoption of feminine technologies, organising principles, social norms and regenerative design patterns.
* Real change comes organically, from the bottom upwards. It cannot be dictated, controlled or managed; it must emerge organically and fluidly.
* The outcomes created by an organisation are a direct consequence of its culture. Nurturing and holding space for culture are the most important and fundamental things a group can do to ensure their long-term success.
* Change must be embodied, lived and practised in order to be realised. The more beautiful world our hearts know is possible must be created first by living inside it. Everything begins in the way we _are;_ the things we _do_ come secondary.
* There is no "thing" that can save us from planetary collapse. No solutions are final. Nothing we create has universal applicability. All we can do is to enact incremental improvements, assess and improve. The success of the process hinges on us staying in conversation with those who use our tools.
* Continual effort and energy must be placed into maintaining counter-cultures to our modern day capitalist Imperialist Patriarchy. External society and norms exert pressure; resistance must be practised in our everyday ways of being.
* _"On the day after the revolution, the revolutionaries will be the new incumbents"._ All things have their time. No group was meant to last forever. We will exist as long as is necessary, until our ways are old and tired and better things have come along.
