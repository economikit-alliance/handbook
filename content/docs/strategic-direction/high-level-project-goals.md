# High-level goals of the collective

_\(these came from Holo-REA originally, so I expect they'll need to be extended or massaged...\)_

* Enable groups of any kind to create and own their economic and social independence.
* Create the most powerful software available for coordinating & managing resources and people.
* Provide a base layer for a new economy that can freely transfer value within and in between communities whilst also allowing them to function autonomously and resiliently.
* Make using the stuff accessible to all peoples.
* Make developing the stuff accessible to all peoples.
* Make governing the stuff accessible to all peoples.
* Move slow and fix things.
