# Editing this website

The workflow between HackMD and Github is slightly awkward, but should be workable.

# Building this website

- Install Hugo. Easiest way is to get a binary from [the releases page](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases). You will need Hugo **Extended** v0.66 or above.
- Run `git clone git@github.com:economikit-alliance/handbook.git --recursive` option to clone the repo with all submodules.
- Run `hugo` from the newly cloned folder to build the website, or `hugo serve` to spin up a development server.
