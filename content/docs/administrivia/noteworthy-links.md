  * Thought: how much do we want to bite off here in terms of trying to standardise schemas? I think there is room for a common article / comment taxonomy, potentially even a common reputation taxonomy. If we define these as GraphQL schemas and think of that as a base platform then it becomes very easy to standardise and mix in functionality that is not part of ValueFlows. Those schemas can form part of a data commons. What else, beyond this kind of stuff, does Commons Engine mean by their “data commons”? That being the case, would better branding for “ValueFlows UI project” potentially be something broader, like \(keeping to the current mission theme\) “P2P economy kit”? We have many contributors from quite diverse industry backgrounds lined up already. A few of us in the VF gang share a vision for a realtime, online, collaborative UI editor that lets you mix components around without having to think about data bindings or backend dependencies and that can generate you custom-tailored apps for your community or group...
