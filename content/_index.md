*(Panels with logos and one-sentence blurbs about each, with links out)*



### ValueFlows GraphQL

> A new sociopolitical order needs a new measurement system. The ValueFlows protocol reimagines accounting as a rich multidimensional weave of attributable information that can be deeply representative of reality, whilst GraphQL brings these possibilities to the next generation of distributed computing.
> 
> [More about ValueFlows and REA Accounting](https://valueflo.ws)
> [More about the modular ValueFlows GraphQL Protocol](https://lab.allmende.io/valueflows/vf-schemas/vf-graphql)


### Holo-REA

> Modular building blocks for the P2P economy&mdash; built to deploy fractally composable, off-grid capable, sovereign social, economic and resource co-ordination spaces of any scope and scale.
> 
> [More about Holo-REA](https://github.com/holo-rea/holo-rea/#readme)
> [Modules in the Holo-REA framework](https://github.com/holo-rea/ecosystem/wiki/Modules-in-the-HoloREA-framework)

### ValueFlows UI

> What is an economic system without an interface? ValueFlows UI packages zero-dependency, zero-configuration building blocks for socioeconomic applications which work atop Holo-REA, [Bonfire](https://commonspub.org/) and any other system implementing the ValueFlows protocol.
> 
> [Work ongoing in the ValueFlows UI initiative](https://lab.allmende.io/valueflows/app-frameworks/vf-ui/-/issues)

### Sacred Capital (the reputation economy)

> Reputation Infrastructure for the distributed economy. Sacred Capital is building a formal language for cultural articualtion, coupled with a 'Reputation Vault' that enables agents to port reputation data across contexts. By activating scalable reputation currencies, they hope to build a multi-dimensional wealth system in the long term. (feel free to edit)
- [ ] @TJSptuQkSdWyLgQxZrAUGg TODO

### Neighbourhoods 

> An over-arching design principle for the distributed economy. 'Neighbourhoods' offers a new way to think about organising network of people and resources. By articulating 'specific culture' using 'generic tools' communities, apps and micro-networks build contextual pathways for the flow of capital and content. 

- [ ] @TJSptuQkSdWyLgQxZrAUGg TODO

### The Kit

> The journey toward a thriving future is long and unknowable. Our work in how we relate, who seeks us out and what we do together is to humbly make the creation of our own digital and economic freedoms accessible to all.
>
> We seek to make the organisation the kit, and the kit the organisation. To create artifacts through our lived experience and the guidance of others which empower groups of all kinds in radical and emancipatory ways.
>
> [More on the path away from surveillance capitalism](:TODO:)

- [ ] @pospi to write a blog post about running a barebones digital organisation and how oppressive tools keep creeping back in
    - Make space to talk about "Languages" and soft-introduce *Perspectivism* concepts
    - Pragmatism, honesty, humility and embracing the reality; whilst knowing that a "something more" is possible

## Stay in touch

- [ ] Write copy for newsletter subscription form
- [ ] Setup a subscriber list- any thoughts on affordable, ethical bulk mail providers?
    - (Otherwise, can just be Google Forms inputting into a GSheet for now.)

## Contact us

- [ ] Decide on categories & other info to include on contact form.
    - Include an option for folks who might want to join the collective


# Post-launch content rollouts

- refine [high level goals](https://hackmd.io/Wb6QLqsrR7e0MOzkbaHXGg)
- integrate [guiding questions](https://hackmd.io/iPxBStE2SvmPWp-4k9JOow) 
- suggest group review/publication of [guiding principles and beliefs](https://hackmd.io/3MtT4XvbQWyPugQ-bxlYhQ?view) (can likely be harvested from engagement criteria)

:DEPRECATED:


- `[homepage]`: *(short summaries, link through to other pages)*
    - who we are
    - what we do
        - Existing (with some tweaks): We are an allied group of intersectional feminist strategists, ethicists and cultural anthropologists presenting...
            -  a vision of stewardship for the Holochain ecosystem and its intersection with other projects promoting economic justice and autonomy from systems of economic oppression.
            -  tools that exemplify these intersections and model humane and vibrant modes of relating, exchanging, and caring for self, other, and community 
    - our goals / vision / theory of change
        - *(link to [narrative board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kiel1sE=/)?)*
        - engagement criteria would also work well here

    - [ ] Who wants to be listed? (CommonsEngine, Permaculture CoLab, Coventina, ...)
- `/partnerships` *(case studies)*
    - [[Suggest holding off on this until relationships are more firmly established]]
    - Might be worth writing up some things about BASYN, Shiro etc in future

    - Is [this joining process](https://hackmd.io/8DbIccKkSOCvAJD6eapfxQ) still accurate? I sense not. Perhaps a simple message about how far in the future we may be able to accept new members will suffice.
    - Publishing our recently cemented [meeting process](https://hackmd.io/o2gnNIBDTSa0L2aPy3IAwA) would be sweet/humanizing
