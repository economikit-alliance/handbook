## Editing this website

There are two places to edit: here, and on HackMD.

The workflow between HackMD and Github is slightly awkward, but has its benefits. The two are treated independently- if changes occur on Github, HackMD must be synchronised via *"Versions"* in the options menu. Similarly, once changes are made on HackMD they must be published back to Github via the same panel. If a dot appears over the "in" and "out" arrows at the top of the versions panel, it means that there are changes to synchronise.

For every newly added or moved file, the synchronisation needs to be reset- it is done on a per-file basis, not per-repository.

To configure page metadata for HackMD, see the [supported list](https://hackmd.io/yaml-metadata) in their docs.

If you're interested in joining our collective or would like to be involved, please join our [Loomio group](https://www.loomio.org/economikit/) and say hi!

## Building this website

- Install Hugo. Easiest way is to get a binary from [the releases page](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases). You will need Hugo **Extended** v0.66 or above.
- Run `git clone git@github.com:economikit-alliance/handbook.git --recursive` option to clone the repo with all submodules.
- Run `hugo` from the newly cloned folder to build the website, or `hugo serve` to spin up a development server.
