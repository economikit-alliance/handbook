# Holo-REA: potential integrations

“**DNA integration**” refers to a third-party, domain-specific Holochain application implementing its own backend logic which in some way interfaces with the REA data that Holo-REA Rust crates can provide.

“**API integration**” refers to a third-party application interfacing with one or more Holo-REA DNAs via the API bridge \(ie. hc-web-client\). The third-party app may be of any type \(in-browser, client/server, any non-Holochain distributed system\).
